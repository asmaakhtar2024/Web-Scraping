# Web-Scraping
For this project, data from a webpage about Liverpool Women's team statistics on FBref is scraped, and some basic data analysis and visualization are done using the data that is retrieved. In order to get the average age, we will first look up the ages of all the players on the page. Additionally, we will compare the performances of games played at home and away. Finding the player with the greatest pass completion will be accomplished by scraping the names of the players and their corresponding pass completion percentages. Finally, we will also talk about the player that has played the most games.
